# Understanding StyleManager in GrapesJS

## Introduction

GrapesJS offers a wide range of features to make web development easier and more intuitive. One such feature is the `StyleManager`, which serves as the control center for styling elements in your project. In this article, we'll explore the functionalities of StyleManager and how you can make the most out of it.

## What is StyleManager?

The `StyleManager` is a GrapesJS component designed to manage the styles and CSS properties of elements within your project. It allows you to define the look and feel of your elements, from basic properties like color and font to more advanced CSS features.

## Key Features

### Predefined Properties

StyleManager comes with a set of predefined properties like font styles, background color, margins, and more, making it easier to get started with styling.

### Custom Properties

You can extend the StyleManager by adding custom properties that are specific to your project's needs, offering greater flexibility.

### Real-time Preview

Any changes made in the StyleManager are immediately reflected on the canvas, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

### CSS Code View

For those who prefer to work directly with code, StyleManager offers a code view where you can manually edit the styles.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can change the background color of an element:

```javascript
// Select the element
const selected = editor.getSelected();

// Change the background color
selected.setStyle({ backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0' });
